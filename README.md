This project was made with React as a part of freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries certification. It allows users to input markdown, such as GitHub flavored markdown, and see a preview of what it would look like.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
